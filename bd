To set a Detect property on the command line: 
	--<property name>=<value>

To see all properties, you may request verbose help log with '-hv'
To see the hidden deprecated properties, you may request them with '-hd'

To get detailed help for a specific property, you may specify the property name with '-h [property]'

To print only a subset of options, you may specify one of the following printable groups with '-h [group]': 
	Detectors, artifactory, blackduck server, cleanup, codelocation, general, logging, paths, policy check, project, project info, proxy, report, source scan, source path, detector, polaris, signature scanner, binary scanner, impact analysis, bazel, bitbake, cargo, conan, conda, cpan, docker, go, gradle, hex, lerna, maven, npm, nuget, packagist, pear, pip, python, ruby, sbt, yarn, blackduck, debug, global, offline, policy, project setting, report setting, search, default

To search options, you may specify a search term with '-h [term]'

To run in interactive mode (which prompts you for the values needed for common use cases), run Detect with the argument '--interactive'
